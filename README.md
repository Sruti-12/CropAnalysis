Agriculture plays a crucial role in India's economy, with over 55% of the population depending on farming. However, many farmers struggle with selecting appropriate crops based on their soil conditions, leading to reduced productivity. This project addresses this challenge through precision agriculture using machine learning.
Key Problem Solved: Farmers often don't choose the right crops based on their soil requirements, which affects productivity and yield.
Solution: An intelligent crop recommendation system that analyzes soil composition, weather conditions, and other environmental factors to suggest the most suitable crops.
